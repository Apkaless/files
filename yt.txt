Dear YouTube Team,
My channel https://www.youtube.com/c/ApkalesS should have not been terminated. I don't believe my videos/channel violated the "community guidelines". Can you please check my channel again to see, if people have wrongly flagged my videos.
My videos had 
NO "Nudity or sexual content "(your reason), that should not be out of the sexual content rules.
NO "Violent or graphic content" there is no graphic content.
NO "Hateful content" there is no political or any hateful speech at all .
NO "Threats". " I never and would never do this.
No "Spam/scam". " there is no spam/scam content.
No "misleading metadata" I always follow the rules for tagging .
And if I it was my mistake to upload content over rules than sorry :( i would like to get back my channel. please youtube team give me my channel back. I will not make any mistake in video upload.
Thank you.
